# Hospital data base management system
I used oracle here,I created four tables to store patient,doctor,patient diagnosis and total(cost) details.It can calculates age of patient and docrot from date of birth I used trigger for it and it generates bill I used view to fetch data from tables(patients,Patients diagnosis,...).It generates bill number aautomatically for which I used sequence(predefined).It calculates total amount from doctor fee which is different for each doctor ,number of days patient stayed at hospital which will be calculated from date of joining and date of discharge,and diagnosis amount that depends on disease patient has.
